Or starting a group together and continuing remotely. Consider that Shoghi Effendi's summer schools were 3-6 weeks in length. That is actually enough time to study book But modern summer schools are 3-6 DAYS!! \n\nHow the heck are people going to master the Dawn-Breakers in 3 days??  \n\nBut what if we can start a Dawn-Breakers class together over a weekend and then continue virtually for 3-6 weeks from home? \n\nThe same group the same friends the same class started locally but coordinated online",
