title: 'Empowering Progeny: The Bahá''í Vision of Parental Pedagogy'
description: >-
  People sometimes think of the Baha'i Faith as a collectivist movement because
  of its emphasis on achieving unity. But in some respects, the Baha'i faith is
  fundamentally about individualism -- that is the individual responsibility to
  seek truth, the individual responsibility to be virtuous and the individual
  responsibility to teach the Cause. The Baha'i Faith is not a religion of
  priests and scholars. It is a religion of teachers. And the first teacher is
  the parent. Nowadays, we have almost completely succumbed to the statist
  approach to collective education -- wherin parents give over their children to
  be educated by the state and have very little role after the age of 5. But
  this is not the Baha'i approach. The Baha'i approach is that the parent is the
  first teacher and the most important teacher.
