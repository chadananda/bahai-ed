title: 'Illuminating the Layers: A Guide to Bahá''í Interpretive Texts'
description: >-
  The passing of Baha'u'llah ended a period of nearly 50 years of continuous and
  progressive revelation as the twin prophets unveiled to mankind a priceless
  heritage of hundreds of tablets, books, poems, treatises and commentaries.
  Following this period (from 1844-1892) came the incomparable ministry of
  Abdu'l-Baha, styled by Baha'u'llah "the Master". His interpretations and
  explanations unfolded further to the world the endless gifts of an
  unprecedented dispensation. The passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha was followed by the
  ministry of Shoghi Effendi, who further unfolded the implications of
  Baha'u'llah's anticipated World Order. A radical order in which Justice was to
  be made the purpose and scope of collective power. This later period was the
  period of interpretation, not revelation. It was the fulfillment of the
  prophecy that the "day will not be followed by night". Now that the
  administrative order has been established, divine authority has carried
  forward, but not the sphere of interpretation. As explained by Shoghi Effend:
  “...it is made indubitably clear and evident that the Guardian of the Faith
  has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal House of
  Justice has been invested with the function of legislating on matters not
  expressly revealed in the teachings. The interpretation of the Guardian,
  functioning within his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the
  enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and
  prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws
  and ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not expressly revealed.”
