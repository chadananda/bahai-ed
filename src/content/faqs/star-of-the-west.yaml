  Star of the West was a Bahá’í periodical published in the United States from
  1910 to 1935. It was the first Bahá’í periodical in the West and played a
  significant role in the early spread of the Bahá’í Faith in the West. The
  magazine was published monthly and included articles, essays, and translations
  of Bahá’í scripture. It was also the first place where many of the writings of
  Bahá'u'lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were published in English. The magazine was
  published by the Bahá’í Publishing Society, which was later merged into the
  National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States. The magazine
  was named after the Star of the West, a term used by Bahá'u'lláh in the
  Kitáb-i-Aqdas to refer to the United States. The magazine was published in
  Chicago, Illinois, and later in New York City. The magazine was edited by
  Laura Clifford Barney, who was a close friend of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and a prominent
  Bahá’í teacher. The magazine was also published in Persian and Arabic
  editions. The magazine was discontinued in 1935, and its contents were later
  published in book form.
