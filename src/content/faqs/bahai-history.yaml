title: 'Chronicles of Faith: Peering into Bahá''í Historical Tapestry'
description: >-
  The history of the Bahá'í Faith, from its origins in 19th-century Persia to
  its emergence as a global religion, including the lives of its Central Figures
  and the development of its institutions. The official history of the early
  years was told by Nabil in a work commissioned by Baha'u'llah. Although
  imperfect as a history, yet the incluion of so many eyewitness accounts as
  well as the contributions made by Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha give it a unique
  value. Beyond this there are many wonderful sources of Baha'i history, from
  stories related by Abdu'l-Baha to pilgrims (Memorials of the Faithful) to the
  many biographies of the Central Figures and their companions by Baha'i
  authors. Notable are works of Hasan Balyuzi, Moojan Momen, Adib Taherzadeh,
  and Fazel Mazindarani. It is my hope to provide a range of study guides and
  helpful resources for the beginning student of Baha'i history including
  timelines and translations of key documents.
