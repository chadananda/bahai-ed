description: >-
  The Bahá'í administrative bodies, firstly established by Bahá'u'lláh, now
  existing at the local, national, and international levels to oversee community
  affairs. They are unique in the range of institutions insasmuch as their range

  fundamental rights is the Aristotalian ideal of "Justice", the foundation of
  civilization and the keynote of Baha'i administration.
