title: 'Sunrise to Naw-Rúz: Embracing the Bahá''í Fast and New Year'
description: >-
  Annual period from March 2 to 20, when Bahá'ís fast from sunrise to sunset,
  engaging in spiritual reflection and preparation for the Bahá'í New Year,
  Naw-Rúz. Baha'i fasting is a time of spiritual renewal and meditation. The
  interpretive writings of Shoghi Effendi and Abdu'l-Baha provide a wealth of
  guidance on the spiritual significance of the fast. It is not dour time of
  mourning and self-denial but a celebration of the preeminence of the spirit
  over the mind and the mind over the body and God's will over all. It is,
  Shoghi Effendi explained, our greatest tool for the spiritual development of
  the soul. In the heavens of the religion of God, the sun is fasting and the
  moon, obligatory prayer.
