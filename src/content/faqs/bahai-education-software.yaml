title: 'Harnessing Bytes for Baha''i Bytes: A Guide to Spiritual Software'
description: >-
  Nobody stands out in the field of Baha'i software quite like Tony. With the
  original "Refer" and "Mars". Unfortunately I was a starving student and unable
  to afford the software. It made me think a bit about the economics of such
  software. Essentially, charging even a dollar meant that everyone who really
  needed the software could not access it. I have nothing against charging money
  to support a project, but this one seemed to not work out the way I wanted.
