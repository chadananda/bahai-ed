title: 'Ninefold Pathways: Unveiling the Bahá''í Temples'
description: >-
  The Bahá'í temples, symbolic of the Faith's principles, are dedicated to the
  oneness of religion and humanity, characterized by nine-sided structures open
  to all. They are symbolic of the center of human life -- of how the point of
  unity for the community is the remembrance of God. In a world that is rapidly
  devolving into those who remember God vs those who forget God, the Baha'i
  temple (literally Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the Dawning Place of the Remembrance of
  God) is a symbol that the remembrance of God is the center of human life and
  the source of all unity and peace.
