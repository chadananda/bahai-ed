category: bahai-education
description: >-
  The principle upheld in Bahá'í education that science and religion are
  complementary systems of knowledge and practice, both contributing to the
  pursuit of truth and the betterment of humanity. The idea is not that religion
  apes the fads of scientists, but that science itself is the pursuit of truth
  -- which is fundamentally a religious endeavor. Abdu'l-Baha explained that the
  true meaning of science is the "love of truth implanted in the heart of man"
  and much of the core doctrinal literature of the Baha'i faith is devoted to
  the requisites for the human mind to approach truth. The danger of bias is
  much more profound than people appreciate, and yet the promise of some degree
  of objectivity is fundamental to the Baha'i teachings -- that man should be
  able to see truth with his own eyes and not through the eyes of other. Science
  and Religion both require individual justice for the "independent
  investigation of truth".
