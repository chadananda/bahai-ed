  Baha'is are often associated with our teachings on world peace. These
  teachings have a fundamentally spritual motivation (we are all children of one
  God) and a fundamentally practical approach (such as ending war by enacting
  settled borders and a system of arbitration and enforcement to outlaw war).
  This is a system of world governance, but unlike the various fascistic
  movements, a system build on decentralization of political power rather than
  centralization and based on limitation of government power to the sphere of
  Justice rather than the unlimited, unrbidled power of the state which has
  wreaked so much havoc in the 20th century. This unique combination of
  international order and decentralizing governance to the local level is
  absolutely unique to the Baha'i vision. Although it includes a vision of
  global order, yet it also includes a federalist model of such decentralization
  as to make Thomas Jefferson blush.
