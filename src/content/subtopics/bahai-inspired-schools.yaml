description: >-
  Educational institutions at all levels that integrate the spiritual and
  academic education based on Bahá'í principles, fostering environments that
  promote moral development alongside intellectual growth. Tarbiat was an
  critical first step in the development of Baha'i schools. And the most
  valuable thing about projects like Tarbiat was that they began early -- during
  the critical period of doctrinal guidance. So we have copious tablets from
  Abdu'l-Baha and letters of Shoghi Effendi on the subject. These are an eternal
  gold mine of principles which the future will explore for centuries to come.
