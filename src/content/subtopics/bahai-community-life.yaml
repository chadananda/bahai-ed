  At the center of Baha'i community life is the administrative institution of
  the "Nineteen Day Feast", established by the Bab, this monthly celebration
  combines a devotional gathering, an administrative meeting and a social
  gathering into one regular event. Providing critical communication and
  interaction between the local governing body and the community as well as
  serving as a regular time of spiritual renewal and fellowship. The Nineteen
  Day Feast is the center of Baha'i community life. Parallel to this is the
  19-day fireside, a private gathering each believer has in his own home for
  friends and neighbors for the purpose of developing friendships and, if they
  are interested, introducing them to the Baha'i Faith. Aside from these two key
  activities, numerous administrative activities fill the calendar, from Local
  Spiritual Assembly meetings to Holy Day celebrations to children's classes and
  study groups. Most community activity will have an educational aspect as study
  and learning are at the center of the pattern of Baha'i life -- a pattern
  which consists of 1) Study of the Word of God, 2) Prayer, 3) Meditation on the
  Teachings and 4) Spiritual Action.
