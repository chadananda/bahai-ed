  The Tablets of the Divine Plan is a series of 13 letters written by
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh, to the Bahá’ís of the United States and
  Canada in 1916 and 1917. The letters were written in response to the growing
  community of Bahá’ís in the West and were intended to provide guidance on the
  spiritual and administrative development of the Bahá’í community. The letters
  were published in 1919 and are considered the core mission of the Baha'i
  community, a Charter of Teaching challenging the American Baha'is to take the
  Faith to every corner of the world. Based on this important mission, the North
  American Baha'is have been repeatedly referred to as the "spiritual
  descendants of the Dawn-Breakers", inasmuch as the Dawn-Breakers were the
  first to arise and spread the Faith of the Bab in the earliest days of the
  Dispensation.
