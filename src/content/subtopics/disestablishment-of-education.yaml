category: bahai-education
description: >-
  The principle upheld in Bahá'í education that education should be
  disassociated from the direct control of the state. Governance has an
  important role in maintaining justice in society (the protection of individual
  rights). But that does not extend to the control of thought. Let's explore how
  Baha'u'llah disestablishes education by requiring universal education, funding
  universal education, but not controlling it. The governing institutions, while
  mandated to ensure education, neither fund nor provision that education.
  Rather, they work with parents to ensure that funds are invested (elsewhere)
  sufficient to tutor the child. This achieves universal education without
  diminishing the crucial responsibilities of the parent, nor of corrupting
  governance with access to the money stream nor the temptation to control the
  minds of the young. This dis-establishment of education while ensuring
  universal education is the most anti-authoritarian model of education ever
  introduced.
