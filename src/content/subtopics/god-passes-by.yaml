description: >-
  God Passes By is the only book written by Shoghi Effendi (although many of his
  letters have been gathered into book form). It comprises a dense outline of
  the first century of the Bahá’í Faith. As such, it represents a unique
  phenomenon -- an interpretation of the principles of a historical period. The
  book was first published in 1944 and is considered to be one of the most
  important works of Bahá’í literature. It covers the period from the
  declaration of the Báb in 1844 to the first centenary of the Bahá’í Faith in
  1944.
