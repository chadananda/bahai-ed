topic: Education as Central to Teaching
topic_slug: education-as-central-to-teaching
category: bahai-education
description: >-
  Study is teaching -- oneself. Education is the teaching of others. Baha'u'llah
  describes teaching as this spectrum from teaching oneself to teaching others.
  He goes as far as making self-teaching the "first obligation" and a proof of
  the sincerity of the teacher. Although education typically extends over three
  spheres: the body, the mind and the spirit, yet the education of the spirit
  has to be the foundation. What is materialism if it is not an inversion of
  this principle? In the Kingdom of God, the first shall be last.
