  Abdu'l-Baha's Divine plan leaves no doubt that the purpose of teaching is not
  merely to increase the number of believers, but to increase the quality of the
  believers. Teaching must be a transformative educational activity or there
  will be "no result whatsoever." Teaching, in this context, generally refers to
  the process of electrifying the soul, of transforming the human spirit with a
  new and broader vision of God's purpose in the world -- a vision which is so
  captivating and compelling that it cannot be separated from action. Thus
  "faith" is defined as "first, conscious knowledge". What is conscious
  knowledge if is not an understanding so profound that it results in immediate,
  direct, spiritual action?
