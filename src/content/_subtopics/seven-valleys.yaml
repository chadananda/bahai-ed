  The Seven Valleys is a book written in Persian by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of
  the Bahá’í Faith. The Four Valleys was also written by Bahá'u'lláh, and the
  two books are usually published together under the title The Seven Valleys and
  the Four Valleys. The two books are distinctly different and have no direct
  relation. The Seven Valleys was written around 1860 in Baghdad after
  Bahá'u'lláh had returned from the mountains of Kurdistan. The work was written
  to a follower of Sufism and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey
  towards God. It was written in response to questions posed by Shaykh
  Muhyi'd-Din, a judge, who was a follower of the Qádiríyyih Order of Sufism.
  The Four Valleys was written around 1857 and answers questions by Shaykh
  ‘Abdu'r-Rahmán, the son of Shaykh Muhyi'd-Din, and outlines the relationship
  between the soul and God.
