category: bahai-faith
description: >-
  A title given to the foremost disciples of Bahá'u'lláh, recognized by their
  outstanding contributions to the spread and establishment of the Bahá'í Faith
  internationally. The Hands of the Cause, while not in any way authoritative or
  infallible, were nevertheless called to a life of heroism and sacrifice. As
  such, their stories are a source of inspiration for Bahai's today.
