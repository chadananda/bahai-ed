  The Hidden Words is a small collection of "gem-like utterances" described by
  Shoghi Effendi as the central ethical work of Bahá'u'lláh. The work was
  written in Baghdád around 1857 in the form of a collection of short
  utterances, 71 in Arabic and 82 in Persian, in which Bahá'u'lláh takes the
  basic essence of certain spiritual truths and recasts them with extreme beauty
  and brevity. The Hidden Words is written in such a way that it can be
  interpreted in both a mystical and ethical way. The work was first published
  in 1858 and has been translated into many languages. The Hidden Words is
  considered a part of the Bahá’í holy writings and is often printed in a small
  booklet and distributed to Bahá’ís for personal use.
