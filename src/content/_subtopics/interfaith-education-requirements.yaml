description: >-
  Baha'is have the duty to educate themselves about the world's religions. This
  is a requirement of the Baha'i Faith. It is not a preference or an option.
  This is based on the foundational belief that all religions contain divine
  inspiration as God has never left man without a path to enlightenment -- no
  matter how hard religious leaders have worked to excite passions and
  prejudices for the eternal purpose of collective manipulation and control. And
  yet, no matter how distorted the teachings of a religion may become, there are
  always parables and metaphors which the sincere seeker can understand -- and
  follow -- to the path of truth. Instead of viewing the various religions as
  competing systems of power, we can view them as a single global heritage of
  divine inspiration. The sacred literature of the world does not belong to the
  priests and scholars. It is our common heritage. It is ours to explore and
  understand. It is ours to share and teach.
