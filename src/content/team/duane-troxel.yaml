  communities worldwide. In the United States, he contributed significantly to
  the faith through homefront pioneering in Hawai’i and service on both National
  and Local Spiritual Assemblies.

  history and its exemplary figures. Currently residing in Connecticut with his
  wife, Dr. Troxel continues to inspire through his writings and dedication to
  the Bahá'í principles of unity, education, and service.
