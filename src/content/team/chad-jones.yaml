biography: >
  Chad Jones, a curious Alaskan fisherman, set out twenty years ago to explore
  the world beyond the rain and mud of Alaska. His adventures led him through
  the last days of the Romanian revolution, to the steppes of Mongolia and the
  sacred city of Mathura. With a palate for the authentic, he savored Szechuan
  dishes in China and studied Arabic in Irbid.


  His escapades include diving into Dhahab’s blue hole, exploring Jerusalem’s
  ancient caves, and soaking in the nocturnal beauty of Akka’s sea-wall.
  Marrying his Punjabi princess in a Rajasthani Moghul castle was a highlight,
  symbolizing his deep connection to the diverse tapestry of global cultures.


  Chad’s adventurous spirit took him by camelback to the pyramids of Giza,
  across the Annapurna Range in Nepal, and tracing the footsteps of Laurence of
  Arabia’s trek to Aqaba. A crowning moment was hoisting a watermelon to a
  sandstone mountain summit in Wadi Rum to witness one of the most epic sunsets
  on the planet.


  Professionally, Chad is as accomplished as he is in his travels. He is the
  disruptive innovator behind software projects like “Ocean” and “Ocean 2.0
  Interfaith Reader”, reflecting his deep appreciation for cultural and
  religious diversity. These projects, developed through Immersive Oceans, a
  non-profit, where he works, intertwine his technical prowess with his love for
  global cultures.


  In his personal life, Chad is a continual learner, driven by an unquenchable
  curiosity about the world and its people. He enjoys documenting his travels
  through photography and writing, sharing his experiences with a growing online
  community. Chad is currently volunteering as Executive Director of Desert Rose
  Bahá’í Institute in Arizona.


  Chad Jones is shaped by thinkers who value individual initiative and moral
  autonomy, such as Friedrich Hayek, whose insights into free-market capitalism
  underscore the importance of personal choice. Henry David Thoreau‘s emphasis
  on civil disobedience and individual power mirrors Chad's focus on personal
  responsibility. Aldous Huxley‘s “The Perennial Philosophy” informs his
  understanding of spirituality as a deeply personal experience. Yuval Noah
  Harari‘s “Sapiens” offers a broad, transcendent view of human history. In the
  digital realm, Maria Popova‘s Brain Pickings and the economic discussions on
  Marginal Revolution by Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok resonate with Chad for
  their exploration of individual impacts in knowledge and economics. These
  influences blend in Chad's worldview, combining his adventurous spirit with a
  deep appreciation for individuality and human progress.
