  The Bahá'í Faith is a monotheistic religion emphasizing the spiritual unity of
  all humankind. Originating with the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh in 19th-century
  Persia, it advocates universal peace, elimination of prejudice, and unity
  among religions. With its global scope, the Faith espouses principles of
  individual search for truth, equality of men and women, and harmonious
  development of science and religion.

    description: >-
      The foundational figure of the Bahá'í Faith, who declared His mission in
      1863 and authored numerous theological and spiritual writings forming the
      core of Bahá'í belief. Unique to the Baha'i faith is the concept of a
      dual-revelation, in which the revelation of Baha'u'llah is seen as a
      continuation of the revelation of the Bab. The writings of Abdu'l-Baha and
      Shoghi Effendi, although having equal authority and validity, are not
      viewed as having the same nature as the writings of Baha'u'llah and the
      Bab. The period of Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi is a time of
      interpretation, not revelation. It is the fulfillment of the prophecy that
      the "day will not be followed by night".

    topic: Hands of the Cause of God
    description: >-
      A title given to the foremost disciples of Bahá'u'lláh, recognized by
      their outstanding contributions to the spread and establishment of the
      Bahá'í Faith internationally. The Hands of the Cause, while not in any way
      authoritative or infallible, were nevertheless called to a life of heroism
      and sacrifice. As such, their stories are a source of inspiration for
      Bahai's today.
  bahai-institutions:
    topic: Bahá'í Institutions
    description: >-
      The Bahá'í administrative bodies, firstly established by Bahá'u'lláh, now
      existing at the local, national, and international levels to oversee
      community affairs. They are unique in the range of institutions insasmuch
      as their range and scope have been defined by the Central Figures of the
      Faith -- resulting in the nucleus of a future system of governance which
      does not have the natural tendency to wander from it's core mandate and
      purpose. The purpose of the Baha'i institutions is to protect the rights
      of the individual which is the key to promotion of unity and peace. This
      idea of protection of fundamental rights is the Aristotalian ideal of
      "Justice", the foundation of civilization and the keynote of Baha'i
      administration.
  bahai-fast-and-naw-ruz:
    topic: Bahá'í Fast and Naw-Rúz
    description: >-
      Annual period from March 2 to 20, when Bahá'ís fast from sunrise to
      sunset, engaging in spiritual reflection and preparation for the Bahá'í
      New Year, Naw-Rúz. Baha'i fasting is a time of spiritual renewal and
      meditation. The interpretive writings of Shoghi Effendi and Abdu'l-Baha
      provide a wealth of guidance on the spiritual significance of the fast. It
      is not dour time of mourning and self-denial but a celebration of the
      preeminence of the spirit over the mind and the mind over the body and
      God's will over all. It is, Shoghi Effendi explained, our greatest tool
      for the spiritual development of the soul. In the heavens of the religion
      of God, the sun is fasting and the moon, obligatory prayer.
  bahai-houses-of-worship:
    topic: Bahá'í Houses of Worship
    description: >-
      The Bahá'í temples, symbolic of the Faith's principles, are dedicated to
      the oneness of religion and humanity, characterized by nine-sided
      structures open to all. They are symbolic of the center of human life --
      of how the point of unity for the community is the remembrance of God. In
      a world that is rapidly devolving into those who remember God vs those who
      forget God, the Baha'i temple (literally Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the Dawning
      Place of the Remembrance of God) is a symbol that the remembrance of God
      is the center of human life and the source of all unity and peace.
  bahai-world-peace-teachings:
    topic: Bahá'í World Peace Teachings
    description: >-
      Baha'is are often associated with our teachings on world peace. These
      teachings have a fundamentally spritual motivation (we are all children of
      one God) and a fundamentally practical approach (such as ending war by
      enacting settled borders and a system of arbitration and enforcement to
      outlaw war). This is a system of world governance, but unlike the various
      fascistic movements, a system build on decentralization of political power
      rather than centralization and based on limitation of government power to
      the sphere of Justice rather than the unlimited, unrbidled power of the
      state which has wreaked so much havoc in the 20th century. This unique
      combination of international order and decentralizing governance to the
      local level is absolutely unique to the Baha'i vision. Although it
      includes a vision of global order, yet it also includes a federalist model
      of such decentralization as to make Thomas Jefferson blush.
  bahai-holy-days:
    topic: Bahá'í Holy Days
    description: >-
      A collection of globally celebrated days within the Bahá'í calendar
      commemorating significant events in the history of the Faith. The Baha'i
      calendar is one of the great gifts of the Bab, who's every detail was a
      poetic symmetry dedicated to the praise of God. His calendar breaks the
      year into 19 months of 19 days with a 4-5 intercalary period dedicated to
      the remembrance of the unknowable, unlimited, uniquely transcendent
      essence of God (refered to as the Há-hút). In his unique solar calendar,
      he wrapped up each year with a month of fasting and prayer, a month named
      after Himself. This month of fasting prepares the way for the month of
      springtime and renewal, the month of Bahá, the month of the Baha'i New
      Year.
  bahai-interpretive-texts:
    topic: Bahá'í Interpretive Texts
    description: >-
      The passing of Baha'u'llah ended a period of nearly 50 years of continuous
      and progressive revelation as the twin prophets unveiled to mankind a
      priceless heritage of hundreds of tablets, books, poems, treatises and
      commentaries. Following this period (from 1844-1892) came the incomparable
      ministry of Abdu'l-Baha, styled by Baha'u'llah "the Master". His
      interpretations and explanations unfolded further to the world the endless
      gifts of an unprecedented dispensation. The passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha was
      followed by the ministry of Shoghi Effendi, who further unfolded the
      implications of Baha'u'llah's anticipated World Order. A radical order in
      which Justice was to be made the purpose and scope of collective power.
      This later period was the period of interpretation, not revelation. It was
      the fulfillment of the prophecy that the "day will not be followed by
      night". Now that the administrative order has been established, divine
      authority has carried forward, but not the sphere of interpretation. As
      explained by Shoghi Effend: “...it is made indubitably clear and evident
      that the Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word
      and that the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the
      function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the
      teachings. The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own
      sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the
      International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is
      to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and
      ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not expressly revealed.”
  bahai-community-life:
    topic: Bahá'í Community Life
    description: >-
      At the center of Baha'i community life is the administrative institution
      of the "Nineteen Day Feast", established by the Bab, this monthly
      celebration combines a devotional gathering, an administrative meeting and
      a social gathering into one regular event. Providing critical
      communication and interaction between the local governing body and the
      community as well as serving as a regular time of spiritual renewal and
      fellowship. The Nineteen Day Feast is the center of Baha'i community life.
      Parallel to this is the 19-day fireside, a private gathering each believer
      has in his own home for friends and neighbors for the purpose of
      developing friendships and, if they are interested, introducing them to
      the Baha'i Faith. Aside from these two key activities, numerous
      administrative activities fill the calendar, from Local Spiritual Assembly
      meetings to Holy Day celebrations to children's classes and study groups.
      Most community activity will have an educational aspect as study and
      learning are at the center of the pattern of Baha'i life -- a pattern
      which consists of 1) Study of the Word of God, 2) Prayer, 3) Meditation on
      the Teachings and 4) Spiritual Action.
  bahai-doctrinal-literature:
    topic: Bahá'í Doctrinal Literature
    description: >-
      Bahá'í doctrinal literature includes the writings of the three Central
      Figures and the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith who was appointed by
      Abdu'l-Baha as the authorized interpreter of the Bahá'í writings. After
      the passing of Shoghi Effendi, no further source of Bahai doctrinal
      literature exists, although the Universal House of Justice plays an
      important role in providing supplementary legislation. Key doctrinal
      literature include the works of the central figures, which have been
      helpfully organized by Shoghi Effendi into "best known works" lists for
      individual study, as well as the published letters of Shoghi Effendi and
      his published books, God Passes By (an outline of the first hundred years)
      and the Dawn-Breakers, a narrative history of the Bab's revelation. This
      book was written by Nabil, a close companion of the Bab, with help from
      Baha'u'llah, with editing by Abdu'l-Baha and finalized in English by
      Shoghi Effendi. As such, it is the only book in the Baha'i canon which was
      not directly written by one of the Central Figures or Shoghi Effendi.
  bahai-history:
    topic: Bahá'í History
    description: >-
      The history of the Bahá'í Faith, from its origins in 19th-century Persia
      to its emergence as a global religion, including the lives of its Central
      Figures and the development of its institutions. The official history of
      the early years was told by Nabil in a work commissioned by Baha'u'llah.
      Although imperfect as a history, yet the incluion of so many eyewitness
      accounts as well as the contributions made by Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha
      give it a unique value. Beyond this there are many wonderful sources of
      Baha'i history, from stories related by Abdu'l-Baha to pilgrims (Memorials
      of the Faithful) to the many biographies of the Central Figures and their
      companions by Baha'i authors. Notable are works of Hasan Balyuzi, Moojan
      Momen, Adib Taherzadeh, and Fazel Mazindarani. It is my hope to provide a
      range of study guides and helpful resources for the beginning student of
      Baha'i history including timelines and translations of key documents.
