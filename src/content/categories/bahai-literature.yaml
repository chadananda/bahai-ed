  Bahá’í Literature encompasses the vast array of texts that constitute the
  teachings, laws, principles, and history of the Bahá’í Faith. It includes
  scripture revealed by the faith's central figures—Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb, and
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—as well as significant writings by individuals appointed as
  leaders within the religious hierarchy. This literature forms the doctrinal
  foundation of the Bahá’í Faith, guiding individual spiritual life and the
  administrative functioning of the Bahá’í community.

  the-dawn-breakers:
    topic: The Dawn-Breakers
    description: >-
      The Dawn-Breakers is a hard book to place in the range of Bahá’í Literature. One might assume that it is merely a book by Nabil Zarandi. But there are some surprises in store. It turns out the book was essentially commissioned by Bahá’u’lláh Himself. Bahá’u’lláh arranged for much of the research. Then he oversaw the writing and contributed several first-hand accounts to the book. The final manuscript was completed before His passing, but unfortunately stolen. It was in his satchel containing his "most valuable manuscripts". It was a major task of Shoghi Effendi to reconstruct the final book, in English, from Nabil's manuscript and notes. While still imperfect as every history, it is a unique, authentic and highly authoritative narrative of the early days of the Bahá’í Faith. The book was placed at the center of Shoghi Effendi's curriculum for Baha'i youth. He emphasized that they must "master the facts recorded therein". The book is a unique and essential part of basic Bahá’í Literature.

  kitab-i-iqan:
    topic: Kitáb-i-Íqán
    description: >-
      The Kitáb-i-Íqán, or the Book of Certitude, is the primary doctrinal work of the Bahá’í Faith, written by Bahá'u'lláh in 1861. The Guardian (Shoghi Effendi) explained that it is "the most important book written on the spiritual significance of the Bahá’í Faith". It was written in response to the questions of the Báb’s maternal uncle and systematically argues the case for an allegorical and broader interpretation of the scriptures. It argues the utter impossibility of approaching truth while the heart is the slightest biased by prejudice. Although addressing spiritual truth, the implication for foundation of all truth, for science itself, is clear. The book was included in a short list of books which every Baha'i should master before attempting to teach others. The Guardian warned, in reference to this book, that "a great harm is done by starting to teach without being thoroughly grounded in the literature."

  star-of-the-west:
    topic: Star of the West
    description: >-
      Star of the West was a Bahá’í periodical published in the United States from 1910 to 1935. It was the first Bahá’í periodical in the West and played a significant role in the early spread of the Bahá’í Faith in the West. The magazine was published monthly and included articles, essays, and translations of Bahá’í scripture. It was also the first place where many of the writings of Bahá'u'lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were published in English. The magazine was published by the Bahá’í Publishing Society, which was later merged into the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States. The magazine was named after the Star of the West, a term used by Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas to refer to the United States. The magazine was published in Chicago, Illinois, and later in New York City. The magazine was edited by Laura Clifford Barney, who was a close friend of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and a prominent Bahá’í teacher. The magazine was also published in Persian and Arabic editions. The magazine was discontinued in 1935, and its contents were later published in book form.

  hidden-words:
    topic: Hidden Words
    description: >-
      The Hidden Words is a small collection of "gem-like utterances" described by Shoghi Effendi as the central ethical work of Bahá'u'lláh. The work was written in Baghdád around 1857 in the form of a collection of short utterances, 71 in Arabic and 82 in Persian, in which Bahá'u'lláh takes the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and recasts them with extreme beauty and brevity. The Hidden Words is written in such a way that it can be interpreted in both a mystical and ethical way. The work was first published in 1858 and has been translated into many languages. The Hidden Words is considered a part of the Bahá’í holy writings and is often printed in a small booklet and distributed to Bahá’ís for personal use.

  seven-valleys:
    topic: Seven Valleys
    description: >-
      The Seven Valleys is a book written in Persian by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í Faith. The Four Valleys was also written by Bahá'u'lláh, and the two books are usually published together under the title The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys. The two books are distinctly different and have no direct relation. The Seven Valleys was written around 1860 in Baghdad after Bahá'u'lláh had returned from the mountains of Kurdistan. The work was written to a follower of Sufism and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was written in response to questions posed by Shaykh Muhyi'd-Din, a judge, who was a follower of the Qádiríyyih Order of Sufism. The Four Valleys was written around 1857 and answers questions by Shaykh ‘Abdu'r-Rahmán, the son of Shaykh Muhyi'd-Din, and outlines the relationship between the soul and God.

The letter was written in 1891, in the final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life, and was addressed to Shaykh Muhammad Taqi, who had persecuted Bahá'ís and had plotted against Bahá'u'lláh. The letter is considered one of Bahá'u'lláh's most important works and is considered to be the last major work of His revelation. The letter is written in Persian and consists of 80 pages. The letter is considered to be a summary of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and a defense of the Bahá’í Faith.

  tablets-of-the-divine-plan:
    topic: Tablets of the Divine Plan
    description: >-
      The Tablets of the Divine Plan is a series of 13 letters written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh, to the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada in 1916 and 1917. The letters were written in response to the growing community of Bahá’ís in the West and were intended to provide guidance on the spiritual and administrative development of the Bahá’í community. The letters were published in 1919 and are considered the core mission of the Baha'i community, a Charter of Teaching challenging the American Baha'is to take the Faith to every corner of the world. Based on this important mission, the North American Baha'is have been repeatedly referred to as the "spiritual descendants of the Dawn-Breakers", inasmuch as the Dawn-Breakers were the first to arise and spread the Faith of the Bab in the earliest days of the Dispensation.

  god-passes-by:

      God Passes By is the only book written by Shoghi Effendi (although many of his letters have been gathered into book form). It comprises a dense outline of the first century of the Bahá’í Faith.

The book was first published in 1944 and is considered to be one of the most important works of Bahá’í literature. It covers the period from the declaration of the Báb in 1844 to the first centenary of the Bahá’í Faith in 1944.
