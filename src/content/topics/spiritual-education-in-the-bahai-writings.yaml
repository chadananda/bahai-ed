  The wealth of authoritative interpretive guidance in the writings of
  Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi constitute the "day that will not be followed
  by night". Exploring these principles will keep Baha'i educators busy for
  centuries to come. Especially when the Baha'i mind begins to mentally
  integrate theological and secular education so that the approach of divine
  Truth becomes the ethos of a divine science and the transformative nature of
  teaching the Cause becomes the pedagogical foundation of the education of
  every child.
