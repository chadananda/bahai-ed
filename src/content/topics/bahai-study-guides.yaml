  In the 40's and 50's, the Baha'i community began to grasp the implications of
  Shoghi Effendi's "rock bottom requirements" for teaching. They started trying
  to approach this challenging standard by creating study guides for various
  critical books. These study guides represent a first step by the believers to
  integrate the requisites of effective teaching. Education in general has
  fallen out of fashion in the world due to the rise of materialistic 'activism'
  as a replacement for knowlege. But the low-information Baha'i teacher is a
  dead-end project and eventually we will have to return to the challenge of
  education. These study guides are a first step, eventually we will have to
  take the second.
