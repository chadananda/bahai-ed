  The Kitáb-i-Íqán, or the Book of Certitude, is the primary doctrinal work of
  the Bahá’í Faith, written by Bahá'u'lláh in 1861. The Guardian (Shoghi
  Effendi) explained that it is "the most important book written on the
  spiritual significance of the Bahá’í Faith". It was written in response to the
  questions of the Báb’s maternal uncle and systematically argues the case for
  an allegorical and broader interpretation of the scriptures. It argues the
  utter impossibility of approaching truth while the heart is the slightest
  biased by prejudice. Although addressing spiritual truth, the implication for
  foundation of all truth, for science itself, is clear. The book was included
  in a short list of books which every Baha'i should master before attempting to
  teach others. The Guardian warned, in reference to this book, that "a great
  harm is done by starting to teach without being thoroughly grounded in the
  literature."
