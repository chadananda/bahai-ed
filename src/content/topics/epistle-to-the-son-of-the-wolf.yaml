  The Epistle to the Son of the Wolf is a letter written by Bahá'u'lláh, the
  founder of the Bahá’í Faith, to a Muslim cleric, Shaykh Muhammad Taqi, known
  as "the Son of the Wolf". The letter was written in 1891, in the final years
  of Bahá'u'lláh's life, and was addressed to Shaykh Muhammad Taqi, who had
  persecuted Bahá'ís and had plotted against Bahá'u'lláh. The letter is
  considered one of Bahá'u'lláh's most important works and is considered to be
  the last major work of His revelation. The letter is written in Persian and
  consists of 80 pages. The letter is considered to be a summary of
  Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and a defense of the Bahá’í Faith.
