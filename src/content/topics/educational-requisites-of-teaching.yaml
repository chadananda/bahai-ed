  It is not popular to point out that some things require a minimum standard of
  education. Education itself ("the banking model") has become obsolete in some
  circles. But the Baha'i Faith is clear that teaching requires education. "A
  great harm is done by starting to teach without being firmly grounded in the
  literature". We would not expect a child to be an engineer or doctor, and yet
  we expect the someone to become a spiritual physician after a weekend
  workshop.
