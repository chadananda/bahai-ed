  The Dawn-Breakers is a hard book to place in the range of Bahá’í Literature.
  One might assume that it is merely a book by Nabil Zarandi. But there are some
  surprises in store. It turns out the book was essentially commissioned by
  Bahá’u’lláh Himself. Bahá’u’lláh arranged for much of the research. Then he
  oversaw the writing and contributed several first-hand accounts to the book.
  The final manuscript was completed before His passing, but unfortunately
  stolen. It was in his satchel containing his "most valuable manuscripts". It
  was a major task of Shoghi Effendi to reconstruct the final book, in English,
  from Nabil's manuscript and notes. While still imperfect as every history, it
  is a unique, authentic and highly authoritative narrative of the early days of
  the Bahá’í Faith. The book was placed at the center of Shoghi Effendi's
  curriculum for Baha'i youth. He emphasized that they must "master the facts
  recorded therein". The book is a unique and essential part of basic Bahá’í
  Literature.
