category: bahai-faith
description: >-
  The foundational figure of the Bahá'í Faith, who declared His mission in 1863
  and authored numerous theological and spiritual writings forming the core of
  Bahá'í belief. Unique to the Baha'i faith is the concept of a dual-revelation,
  in which the revelation of Baha'u'llah is seen as a continuation of the
  revelation of the Bab. The writings of Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi,
  although having equal authority and validity, are not viewed as having the
  same nature as the writings of Baha'u'llah and the Bab. The period of
  Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi is a time of interpretation, not revelation. It
  is the fulfillment of the prophecy that the "day will not be followed by
  night".
