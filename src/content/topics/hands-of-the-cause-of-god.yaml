  A title given to the foremost disciples of Bahá'u'lláh, recognized by their
  outstanding contributions to the spread and establishment of the Bahá'í Faith

  infallible, were nevertheless called to a life of heroism and sacrifice. As
  such, their stories are a source of inspiration for Bahai's today.
