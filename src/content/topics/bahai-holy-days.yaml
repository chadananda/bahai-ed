  A collection of globally celebrated days within the Bahá'í calendar
  commemorating significant events in the history of the Faith. The Baha'i
  calendar is one of the great gifts of the Bab, who's every detail was a poetic
  symmetry dedicated to the praise of God. His calendar breaks the year into 19
  months of 19 days with a 4-5 intercalary period dedicated to the remembrance
  of the unknowable, unlimited, uniquely transcendent essence of God (refered to
  as the Há-hút). In his unique solar calendar, he wrapped up each year with a
  month of fasting and prayer, a month named after Himself. This month of
  fasting prepares the way for the month of springtime and renewal, the month of
  Bahá, the month of the Baha'i New Year.
