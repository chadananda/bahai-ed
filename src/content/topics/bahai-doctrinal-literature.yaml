  Bahá'í doctrinal literature includes the writings of the three Central Figures
  and the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith who was appointed by Abdu'l-Baha as the
  authorized interpreter of the Bahá'í writings. After the passing of Shoghi
  Effendi, no further source of Bahai doctrinal literature exists, although the
  Universal House of Justice plays an important role in providing supplementary
  legislation. Key doctrinal literature include the works of the central
  figures, which have been helpfully organized by Shoghi Effendi into "best
  known works" lists for individual study, as well as the published letters of
  Shoghi Effendi and his published books, God Passes By (an outline of the first
  hundred years) and the Dawn-Breakers, a narrative history of the Bab's
  revelation. This book was written by Nabil, a close companion of the Bab, with
  help from Baha'u'llah, with editing by Abdu'l-Baha and finalized in English by
  Shoghi Effendi. As such, it is the only book in the Baha'i canon which was not
  directly written by one of the Central Figures or Shoghi Effendi.
