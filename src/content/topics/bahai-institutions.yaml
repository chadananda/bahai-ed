  The Bahá'í administrative bodies, firstly established by Bahá'u'lláh, now
  existing at the local, national, and international levels to oversee community
  affairs. They are unique in the range of institutions insasmuch as their range
  and scope have been defined by the Central Figures of the Faith -- resulting
  in the nucleus of a future system of governance which does not have the
  natural tendency to wander from it's core mandate and purpose. The purpose of
  the Baha'i institutions is to protect the rights of the individual which is
  the key to promotion of unity and peace. This idea of protection of
  fundamental rights is the Aristotalian ideal of "Justice", the foundation of
  civilization and the keynote of Baha'i administration.
