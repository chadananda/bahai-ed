  program designed to empower a generation to become effective Baha'i teachers.
  Much of our literature translation corpus in English comes from this period of
  unprecedented fecundity. The generation he raised up were the best teachers we
  have ever seen. They launched themselves into the world in 1938 and tackled
  international goals and plans in a spectacular manner.
