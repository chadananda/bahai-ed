  Bahá'í education encompasses the pedagogical principles and practices derived
  from the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, aimed at personal development and
  societal transformation. It emphasizes the unity of humankind, the acquisition
  of virtues, the importance of service, and the harmony of science and
  religion, within formal and informal educational settings.

      Educational institutions at all levels that integrate the spiritual and
      academic education based on Bahá'í principles, fostering environments that
      promote moral development alongside intellectual growth. Tarbiat was an critical first step in the development of Baha'i schools. And the most valuable thing about projects like Tarbiat was that they began early -- during the critical period of doctrinal guidance. So we have copious tablets from Abdu'l-Baha and letters of Shoghi Effendi on the subject. These are an eternal gold mine of principles which the future will explore for centuries to come.

    topic: Bahá'í Study Guides
    description: >-
      In the 40's and 50's, the Baha'i community began to grasp the implications of Shoghi Effendi's "rock bottom requirements" for teaching. They started trying to approach this challenging standard by creating study guides for various critical books. These study guides represent a first step by the believers to integrate the requisites of effective teaching. Education in general has fallen out of fashion in the world due to the rise of materialistic 'activism' as a replacement for knowlege. But the low-information Baha'i teacher is a dead-end project and eventually we will have to return to the challenge of education. These study guides are a first step, eventually we will have to take the second.

      Nobody stands out in the field of Baha'i software quite like Tony. With the original "Refer" and "Mars". Unfortunately I was a starving student and unable to afford the software. It made me think a bit about the economics of such software. Essentially, charging even a dollar meant that everyone who really needed the software could not access it. I have nothing against charging money to support a project, but this one seemed to not work out the way I wanted.

    topic: Spiritual Education in the Bahá'í Writings

      The wealth of authoritative interpretive guidance in the writings of Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi constitute the "day that will not be followed by night". Exploring these principles will keep Baha'i educators busy for centuries to come. Especially when the Baha'i mind begins to mentally integrate theological and secular education so that the approach of divine Truth becomes the ethos of a divine science and the transformative nature of teaching the Cause becomes the pedagogical foundation of the education of every child.

  education-as-central-to-teaching:
    topic: Education as Central to Teaching
    description: >-
      Study is teaching -- oneself. Education is the teaching of others. Baha'u'llah describes teaching as this spectrum from teaching oneself to teaching others. He goes as far as making self-teaching the "first obligation" and a proof of the sincerity of the teacher. Although education typically extends over three spheres: the body, the mind and the spirit, yet the education of the spirit has to be the foundation. What is materialism if it is not an inversion of this principle? In the Kingdom of God, the first shall be last.

  educational-requisites-of-teaching:
    topic: Educational Requisites of Teaching
    description: >-
      It is not popular to point out that some things require a minimum standard of education. Education itself ("the banking model") has become obsolete in some circles. But the Baha'i Faith is clear that teaching requires education. "A great harm is done by starting to teach without being firmly grounded in the literature". We would not expect a child to be an engineer or doctor, and yet we expect the someone to become a spiritual physician after a weekend workshop.

  the-rise-and-fall-of-the-summer-school:
    topic: The Rise and Fall of the Summer School
    description: >-
      The summer school was a central feature of the Baha'i community in the early 20th century. It was a time of spiritual retreat, education, and fellowship. It was a time to recharge and reconnect. It was a time to learn about the Baha'i Faith and to learn how to teach the Baha'i Faith. It was a time to learn how to be a Baha'i. It was a time to learn how to be a better person. It was a time to learn how to be a better Baha'i. It was a time to learn how to be a better teacher. It was a time to learn how to be a better student. It was a time to learn how to be a better friend. It was a time to learn how to be a better parent. It was a time to learn how to be a better spouse.

  teaching-is-about-quality-not-quantity:
    topic: Teaching is About Quality, not Quantity
    description: >-
      Abdu'l-Baha's Divine plan leaves no doubt that the purpose of teaching is not merely to increase the number of believers, but to increase the quality of the believers. Teaching must be a transformative educational activity or there will be "no result whatsoever." Teaching, in this context, generally refers to the process of electrifying the soul, of transforming the human spirit with a new and broader vision of God's purpose in the world -- a vision which is so captivating and compelling that it cannot be separated from action. Thus "faith" is defined as "first, conscious knowledge". What is conscious knowledge if is not an understanding so profound that it results in immediate, direct, spiritual action?

    topic: Shoghi Effendi's Contribution to Baha'i Education
    description: >-
      A full half of the ministry of Shoghi Effendi can be viewed as an educational program designed to empower a generation to become effective Baha'i teachers. Much of our literature translation corpus in English comes from this period of unprecedented fecundity. The generation he raised up were the best teachers we have ever seen. They launched themselves into the world in 1938 and tackled international goals and plans in a spectacular manner.

  integration-of-science-and-religion:
    topic: Integration of Science and Religion
    description: >-
      The principle upheld in Bahá'í education that science and religion are
      complementary systems of knowledge and practice, both contributing to the
      pursuit of truth and the betterment of humanity. The idea is not that religion apes the fads of scientists, but that science itself is the pursuit of truth -- which is fundamentally a religious endeavor. Abdu'l-Baha explained that the true meaning of science is the "love of truth implanted in the heart of man" and much of the core doctrinal literature of the Baha'i faith is devoted to the requisites for the human mind to approach truth. The danger of bias is much more profound than people appreciate, and yet the promise of some degree of objectivity is fundamental to the Baha'i teachings -- that man should be able to see truth with his own eyes and not through the eyes of other. Science and Religion both require individual justice for the "independent investigation of truth".

  interfaith-education-requirements:
    topic: Interfaith Education Requirements
    description: >-
      Baha'is have the duty to educate themselves about the world's religions. This is a requirement of the Baha'i Faith. It is not a preference or an option. This is based on the foundational belief that all religions contain divine inspiration as God has never left man without a path to enlightenment -- no matter how hard religious leaders have worked to excite passions and prejudices for the eternal purpose of collective manipulation and control. And yet, no matter how distorted the teachings of a religion may become, there are always parables and metaphors which the sincere seeker can understand -- and follow -- to the path of truth. Instead of viewing the various religions as competing systems of power, we can view them as a single global heritage of divine inspiration. The sacred literature of the world does not belong to the priests and scholars. It is our common heritage. It is ours to explore and understand. It is ours to share and teach.

  parental-role-in-bahai-education:
    topic: Parental Role in Bahá'í Education
    description: >-
      People sometimes think of the Baha'i Faith as a collectivist movement because of its emphasis on achieving unity. But in some respects, the Baha'i faith is fundamentally about individualism -- that is the individual responsibility to seek truth, the individual responsibility to be virtuous and the individual responsibility to teach the Cause. The Baha'i Faith is not a religion of priests and scholars. It is a religion of teachers. And the first teacher is the parent. Nowadays, we have almost completely succumbed to the statist approach to collective education -- wherin parents give over their children to be educated by the state and have very little role after the age of 5. But this is not the Baha'i approach. The Baha'i approach is that the parent is the first teacher and the most important teacher.

  disestablishment-of-education:
    topic: Disestablishment of Education
    description: >-
      The principle upheld in Bahá'í education that education should be
      disassociated from the direct control of the state. Governance has an important role in maintaining justice in society (the protection of individual rights). But that does not extend to the control of thought. Let's explore how Baha'u'llah disestablishes education by requiring universal education, funding universal education, but not controlling it. The governing institutions, while mandated to ensure education, neither fund nor provision that education. Rather, they work with parents to ensure that funds are invested (elsewhere) sufficient to tutor the child. This achieves universal education without diminishing the crucial responsibilities of the parent, nor of corrupting governance with access to the money stream nor the temptation to control the minds of the young. This dis-establishment of education while ensuring universal education is the most anti-authoritarian model of education ever introduced.
